# :speech_balloon: OmTraffic 
OmTraffic is a fast and efficient Python script that enables you to send a large number of messages to random strangers on Omegle quickly. :rocket: It's for educational purposes only! :mortar_board:

## ðŸŒŸStar this repo if you enjoy using our tool and want it to stay updated and working

## :eyes: Preview 
It is recommended to use good premium proxies for the best performance. We can highly recommend you intenseproxy.com but don't use rotating proxies, they wont work!
If you use proxies with username and password, make sure that they are in the format of username:password@ip:port
